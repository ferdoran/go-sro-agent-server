An agent server implementation of the game Silkroad Online ,
based on [go-sro-framework](https://github.com/ferdoran/go-sro-framework) 
and [go-sro-fileutils](https://github.com/ferdoran/go-sro-fileutils),
written in Golang. Also [raylib-go](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go)
is being used for the navmesh viewer in `cmd/navmesh-viewer/`

It was developed using vSRO 1.88 files.
Using different versions might result in errors and bugs.

## Acknowledgement

As the development was not a single person's effort,
I want to thank [DaxterSoul](https://www.elitepvpers.com/forum/members/1084164-daxtersoul.html)
for sharing his wide knowledge on the game and its peculiarities.

Without his packet and file structure documentation this would not have been possible.

## Additional Projects

As this is just a framework, there are also projects taking this framework into use:

- [go-sro-fileutils](https://github.com/ferdoran/go-sro-fileutils)
- [go-sro-framework](https://github.com/ferdoran/go-sro-framework)
- [go-sro-gateway-server](https://github.com/ferdoran/go-sro-gateway-server)

## Contribution

If you want to engage in the development, you are free to so.
Simply fork this project and submit your changes via Pull Requests.

There is some documentation around the game located under `docs`,
however it does not give any guideline.
It is more like a collection of information I gathered over time.
Some of it may still be in German, so take my apologies here for not translating them yet.

Providing a usable documentation is still a big item on my TODO list for this project.
Any help on this is highly appreciated.

If you have any more questions, feel free to contact me.
